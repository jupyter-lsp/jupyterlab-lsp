# Config Schemas

These are configuration schemas extracted from canonical upstreams:

- [bash-language-server](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/blob/master/vscode-client/package.json)
- [pylsp](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/blob/develop/pylsp/config/schema.json)
- [dockerfile-language-server-nodejs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/blob/master/package.json)
- [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml/blob/master/package.json)

> All of the configurations are sent to the Language Server, but only some of them
> are actually acted upon, but we don't know which is which, yet.
