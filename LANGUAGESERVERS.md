# Language Servers

`jupyter-lsp` does not come with any Language Servers! However, we will try to use
them if they _are_ installed and we know about them (you can disable this behavior
by configuring [`autodetect`](#autodetect)).

Use a package manager to install a [language server][lsp-implementations]
(also [this list][langserver]) from the tables below: these implementations are
tested to work with `jupyter-lsp`.

## Adding custom language servers

### Jupyter config via `traitlets`

Like the Jupyter Notebook server, JupyterHub and other Jupyter interactive computing
tools, `jupyter-lsp` can be configured via [Python or JSON files][notebook-config]
in _well-known locations_. You can find out where to put them on your system with:

[notebook-config]: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html

```bash
jupyter --paths
```

They will be merged from bottom to top, and the directory where you launch your
`notebook` server wins, making it easy to check in to version control. The absolute
minimum listing requires `argv` (a list of shell tokens to launch the server)
and `languages` (which languages to respond to), but many number of other options
to enrich the user experience are available in the
[schema](./py_src/jupyter_lsp/schema/schema.json).

```python
# ./jupyter_notebook_config.json                 ---------- unique! -----------
#                                               |                              |
# or e.g.                                       V                              V
# $PREFIX/etc/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.d/a-language-server-implementation.json
{
  "LanguageServerManager": {
    "language_servers": {
      "a-language-server-implementation": {
        "argv": ["/absolute/path/to/a-language-server", "--stdio"],
        "languages": ["a-language"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

More complex configurations that can't be hard-coded may benefit from the python approach:

```py
# jupyter_notebook_config.py
import shutil

# c is a magic, lazy variable
c.LanguageServerManager.language_servers = {
    "a-language-server-implementation": {
        # if installed as a binary
        "argv": [shutil.which("a-language-server")],
        "languages": ["a-language"]
    },
    "another-language-implementation": {
        # if run like a script
        "argv": [shutil.which("another-language-interpreter"), "another-language-server"],
        "languages": ["another-language"]
    }
}
```

### Python `entry_points`

`pip`-installable packages in the same environment as the Jupyter `notebook` server
can be automatically detected as providing a language server spec. These are a
little more involved: see [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Configuration Options

Like `language_servers`, these can be configured via `jupyter_notebook_config.json`
(or .py) or via command line arguments to `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.

## nodejs

> default: autodetect

A custom absolute path to your `nodejs` executable.

## autodetect

> default: True

`jupyter-lsp` will look for all [known language servers](#installing-language-servers).
User-configured `language_servers` of the same implementation will be preferred
over `autodetect`ed ones.

## node_roots

> default: []

Absolute paths to search for `node_modules`, such as `nodejs`-backed language servers.
The order is, roughly:

- the folder where `notebook` or `lab` was launched
- the JupyterLab `staging` folder
- wherever `conda` puts global node modules
- wherever some other conventions put it

## extra_node_roots

> default: []

Additional places `jupyter-lsp` will look for `node_modules`. These will be checked
_before_ `node_roots`.
