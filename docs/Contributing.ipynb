    "## Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clean up your code, and check for using the project's style guide with:\n",

    "## Specs\n",
    "\n",
    "While language servers can be configured by the user using a simple JSON or\n",
    "Python [configuration file](./Configuring.ipynb), it is preferable to provide\n",
    "users with an option that does not require manual configuration. The language\n",
    "server specifications (specs) wrap the configuration (as would be defined by the\n",

    "\n",
    "- distributed using PyPI/conda-forge and made conveniently available to users\n",
    "  for `pip install` and/or `conda install`\n",
    "- contributed to the collection of built-in specs of jupyter-lsp by opening a PR\n",
    "  (preferable for popular language servers, say >100 users)\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case the detection of available specifications uses Python\n",

    "\n",
    "> If an advanced user installs, locates, and configures, their own language\n",
    "> server it will always win vs an auto-configured one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a spec\n",
    "\n",
    "A spec is a Python callable (a function, or a class with `__call__` method) that\n",
    "accepts a single argument, the `LanguageServerManager` instance, and returns a\n",
    "dictionary of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"python-language-server\": {            # the name of the implementation\n",
    "      \"version\":  SPEC_VERSION,          # the version of the spec schema (an integer)\n",
    "      \"argv\": [\"python\", \"-m\", \"pyls\"],  # a list of command line arguments\n",
    "      \"languages\": [\"python\"],           # a list of languages it supports\n",
    "      \"mime_types\": [\"text/python\", \"text/x-ipython\"]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "The above example is only intended as an illustration and not as an up-to-date\n",
    "guide. For details on the dictionary contents, see the [schema][] definition and\n",
    "[built-in specs][]. Basic concepts (meaning of the `argv` and `languages`\n",
    "arguments) are also explained in the [configuration files](./Configuring.ipynb)\n",
    "documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When contributing a specification we recommend to make use of the helper classes\n",
    "and other [utilities][] that take care of the common use-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ShellSpec` helps to create specs for servers that can be started from\n",
    "  command-line\n",
    "- `PythonModuleSpec` is useful for servers which are Python modules\n",
    "- `NodeModuleSpec` will take care of finding Node.js modules\n",
    "\n",
    "See the built-in [built-in specs][] for example implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spec should only be advertised if the command _could actually_ be run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- its runtime/interpreter (e.g. `julia`, `nodejs`, `python`, `r`, `ruby`) is\n",
